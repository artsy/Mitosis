### Mitosis

A Facebook Messenger bot for Artsy.

Allows you to explore Artworks, Artists and Articles in a pretty deep way by just clicking around.

Currently it's being hosted on my personal heroku, and with my own personal facebook app "Ortsy-art". Will be migrated into a real staging environment at some point.

TODO:

* Allow you to connect to your Artsy account
* Offer a way to get occasional notifications to trigger exploration 
* Think about what chat-like interfaces feel like in practice

This is based on the Facebook Sample app, then I added flow, and started making it [a real project](https://github.com/fbsamples/messenger-platform-samples).
